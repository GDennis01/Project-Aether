## Aether
**Aether** - **A**nalysis of **E**volved **T**hermal **H**ydrodynamics in **E**mission **R**egions - is a simulation tool developed in Godot 4.4 (version may be subject to change) to simulate the trajectory of dust coma/tail gas particles of a comet (which is approximated as a sphere).

It's still in **WIP** and as such, only a small subset of the features are available.
So far, the available features are:
- Moving around the comet
- Editing rotation/inclination of both the comet and sun

## How to run
Install [https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.4-stable](Godot 4.4) then import the project and run it.
